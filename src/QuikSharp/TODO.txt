* decimal vs double everywhere
* order could come without transaction - manual trade from Quik, create an empty transaction
for the given ID;
* for the same reason - manual transactions - we could only group related transactions
by the first one. E.g. if 2 manual trades were done with the same comment, there is just no
way to match trades
* trades could be matched to orders without transactions, rethink how to do it
